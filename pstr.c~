 * _pstr - Prints the string starting at the top of the stack.

 *
 * Description: The pstr opcode prints the string starting at the top of the stack.
 * Each element of the stack is treated as an ASCII value of a character. The string
 * stops printing when either the stack is empty, the value of the element is 0, or
 * the value of the element is not in the ASCII table. If the stack is empty, it
 * prints only a new line.
